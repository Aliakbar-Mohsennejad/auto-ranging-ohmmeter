# Auto-Ranging Ohmmeter

This project was developed as part of the "Digital Systems 2" course at K. N. Toosi University of Technology. The goal was to design and implement an ohmmeter capable of automatically selecting the appropriate resistance measurement range.

##  Project Overview

- **Type**: Academic Project  
- **Course**: Digital Systems 2  
- **Student**: Aliakbar Mohsennejad  
- **University**: K. N. Toosi University of Technology  
- **Language**: Persian (video presentation)

##  Features

- Automatic detection of resistor value range  
- Uses **STM32** board for core processing  
- Based on modified version of an open-source reference design  
- Includes both **circuit implementation** and **Arduino-based code**

##  Project Contents

- `code/` – Source code for microcontroller
